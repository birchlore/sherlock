<p>We've been scanning your customer followers so that we can show you the Benefits of Groupie, and we found a major influencer:</p>

<p><%= bio(@celebrity) %></p>

<ul>

 <% end %>

 <% if @celebrity.instagram_celebrity? %>
   <li>Instagram Followers: <%= instagram_follower_count(@celebrity) %></li>
 <% end %>
</ul>

<p>You should reach out to this customer as soon as possible, here are the best ways to get a response:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For a major celebrity - send a personal email, mention you are fans, and say that you are including some of your favorite products for free. Don't as for anything in return yet, but followup at a later date</li>
  <li>For influencers (but not major celebrities), send an email saying that your store is offering a promotion for an extra free product in return for a Twitter/Instagram/Youtube mention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately we can't continue scanning your customers unless you <%= link_to 'upgrade', plan_path %>.</p>
