You just made a sale to <%= name(@celebrity) %>

We've been scanning your customer followers so that we can show you the Benefits of Groupie, and we found a major influencer:

<%= bio(@celebrity) %>


  <% if @celebrity.youtube_celebrity? %>
   Youtube Subscribers: <%= youtube_subscriber_count(@celebrity) %>
 <% end %>

 <% if @celebrity.twitter_celebrity? %>
   Twitter Followers: <%= twitter_follower_count(@celebrity) %>
 <% end %>

 <% if @celebrity.instagram_celebrity? %>
   Instagram Followers: <%= instagram_follower_count(@celebrity) %>
 <% end %>


You should reach out to this customer as soon as possible, here are the best ways to get a response:

  For a major celebrity - send a personal email, mention you are fans, and say that you are including some of your favorite products for free. Don't as for anything in return yet, but followup at a later date
  For influencers (but not major celebrities), send an email saying that your store is offering a promotion for an extra free product in return for a Twitter/Instagram/Youtube mention.

Unfortunately we can't continue scanning your customers unless you upgrade here: <%= plan_path %>.
