It’s time. He’ll be here in 10min and I still haven’t figured out what to wear. First impressions are everything. Is this too dressy? I don’t even know what restaurant we’re going to. Should I wear heels or do I want to wear something more comfortable?</p>

Shit. He’s here.

<div class="hidden-blog"><p style="intro">I never thought I would meet someone who likes country as much as I do! I show him a few pictures from when I went horseback riding in the country. He points to one of the pictures and says “I like your style.”</p><p style="intro">If only I could ditch this black dress and instantly change into my favorite western outfit. Well, it’s too late now!</p>Ever had one of those moments? How cool would it be to instantly change what you’re wearing the moment you don’t feel right in an outfit?

Maybe it sounds too far fetched, but it’s possible. Our future is a collective vision of how innovators like you and I want to see our world.

I envision a world where we have the ability to change our outfit to reflect how we feel. A world where we are not limited to one outfit per day and we can instantly change our fashion on our virtual avatars.

In a few years from now we will have the ability to enter a virtual world of beautiful things. One where we are never late for dates, we glow with confidence, and our avatar - the virtual representation of us - is fashionably stylish and ready to rock every occasion.

Fashion is an ever changing journey, inspired by you. Fashion is dynamic, because you are dynamic, and so will be our future world.

Everything you see around you is created by men and women no different than us. They had a vision for how they wanted to see the world change. They imagined, they persevered, and they succeeded.

Once you realize that you can change your world...

That you can create new ideas and build off existing ideas...

You will be driving your life forward with purpose.

You will bring your vision to life.

It's only a matter of time.
